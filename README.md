## 🎯 Project Objective
Emergency Rooms are high-pressure environments. This project analyzes **9,216 patient visits** (April 2023 - Oct 2024) to identify bottlenecks in hospital operations. The goal was to understand why the **Patient Satisfaction Score** had dipped to a concerning **4.99/10**.

## 💡 Key Findings

### 1. The Wait Time Correlation
Patients are waiting an average of **35.3 minutes**. Data suggests this delay is the primary driver behind the low **4.99/10** Satisfaction Score. Target is missed for **40%** of patients.

### 2. The "Walk-In" Challenge
**60%** of patients (approx 5,400) arrive with **"No Referral"**. These are unexpected walk-ins, making traditional appointment-based staffing ineffective.

### 3. Patient Demographics
- **Admission Rate:** A very high **50%** of visitors are admitted, indicating serious medical cases.
- **Gender:** Slightly higher Male presence (**51.05%**) vs Female (**48.69%**).
- **Peak Traffic:** The busiest days are **Monday (1,377 visits)** and **Saturday (1,322 visits)**.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Data Source:** Hospital ER Data (`.csv`) - 19 Months Data.
- **Power BI:** For ETL and creating the "Day & Hour" Heatmap.
- **DAX:** Used to calculate average wait times and admission rates.

---

## 📈 Recommendations
To improve Satisfaction Scores:
1.  **Surge Staffing:** Increase doctor headcount specifically on **Mondays & Saturdays** and during the **11 AM - 1 PM** rush hours.
2.  **Fast-Track Triage:** Since 60% are walk-ins, implement a rapid triage zone to filter minor cases and reduce the waiting backlog.
